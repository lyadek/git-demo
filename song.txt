There is a house  way down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

Mother was a tailor, yeah, yeah
Sewed my Levi jeans
My father was a gamblin' man, yeah, yeah
Down, way down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gamblin' man ever needs
Is a suitcase, Lord, and a trunk
And the only time
